## StatEditor.js

### Features
- Allows changing stats (**both global and temp variables**) from the webpage itself.
- Enables freezing variable values.

### Installation
- Download and paste the [file](https://github.com/sid-the-sloth1/ChoiceScriptTools/blob/main/StatEditor/Stateditor.js "file") in "**web**" directory along with other js files of Choicescript.

- Open the "**mygame**" folder and open the **index.html** in a text editor/IDE.

- Paste the below snippet before the `<script src="mygame.js"></script>` line. If you change the name of file after downloading, make sure to change the below line accordingly.

```html
<script src="../Stateditor.js"></script>
```
- Search for `window.storeName`, if it equals to `null`, then replace `null` with any string of letters enclosed in quotes (eg: `"vdcgfsdgjbfjgvdsjgfhvjadctcacxddsjvldjg"`). The storeName serves as an identifier for saving data in browser storage, so ensure it is unique for each game you develop or test.

- Save the file.
